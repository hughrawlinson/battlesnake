# Examples

Some example snake implementations using the `battlesnake` package.

## Example Snake

A very basic snake that implements the required handlers and that's it. It moves
the snake in random directions.

## Ngrok Snake

A copy of the example snake, except that it uses ngrok to expose the snake to
the internet, so that you can have the battlesnake engine call it.

## Inspired by Joe and Kev Coding Badly

A snake that implements some basic rules of the game. It's a bit more complex,
doing things like not moving into walls, not moving into other snakes, etc.
