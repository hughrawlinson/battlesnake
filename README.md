# Battlesnake JS

A wrapper library and types for Battlesnake, written in Typescript. Should work, but ymmv for now!

Todo:

- [ ] Figure out how to write intellisense docs for types - I don't want to make classes for everything
- [ ] TypeDoc generated docs
- [ ] Plugin architecture
- [ ] Plugin: ngrok
- [ ] Plugin: repl.it
- [ ] Plugin: Metrics API endpoint
  - Number of requests handled
  - Average latency
  - Most recent game started
  - Whatever else is interesting
- [ ] Plugin: Game State API?
- [ ] Plugin: Monitoring site
  - Watch games live
  - View fun stuff
